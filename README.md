# blog-fullstack-ui

This is the UI / frontend part of a fullstack mini blog project.

Find the API / backend part at: https://github.com/losrobbos/blog-fullstack-api

## Setup after cloning

Install packages: `npm i`

Starting the frontend
- `npm run dev`

To connect with an API:
- Launch the API or - in case you deployed it already - grab the URL of the deployed API
- Copy the .env.sample file to a new .env file
- Adapt the API URL in the .env file to point to your backend / API

That's it!
